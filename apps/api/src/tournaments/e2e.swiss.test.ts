/**
 * One official Swiss event, end to end, over the real HTTP surface and through real rooms.
 *
 * What makes this an E2E rather than a bigger integration test is that nothing is stubbed on the
 * path a player takes: the deck is saved and the entry made over HTTP, presence is asserted over
 * HTTP, the games are played by an actual {@link AegisRoom} reporting an actual authoritative
 * result, the no-show is settled by the actual deadline scheduler, and the disputed confrontation is
 * settled by the actual arbitration command. The substitutions are the database (pg-mem) and the
 * clock — and the clock is substituted by passing instants as VALUES, never by faking timers, so the
 * test asserts the exact boundaries the ruleset names instead of waiting for them.
 *
 * Three shortcuts, all disclosed rather than hidden:
 *
 *  1. **Sign-in is not over HTTP.** Sessions are minted through the store, because the magic-link
 *     flow needs an email provider and the Discord flow an OAuth round trip. Everything a signed-in
 *     player then does — the deck, the entry, the check-in, presence, the concession — goes over the
 *     wire under that cookie, so the authorization path each endpoint enforces is the real one.
 *  2. **The attendance ladder is armed by the test**, because round publication does not arm it yet.
 *  3. **Rounds 2 and 3 are mostly conceded** rather than played in rooms, to reach the champion
 *     without twenty more room boots. Round 1 covers the room path.
 *
 * The second case below runs the same surface with `topCut: true` over the smallest field the
 * official table cuts at all, so the Swiss-to-cut transition, the bracket and its champion are
 * covered by the same end-to-end path rather than only by the unit suite.
