/**
 * Whether a short field is completed with bots, and with which ones — decided as pure arithmetic
 * over the numbers, so the policy can be read and tested without a database anywhere near it.
 *
 * The rules this encodes come from the implementation plan's "Bots" section, and the order they are
 * applied in is itself the policy:
 *
 *  1. **Below the minimum, cancel.** A field with fewer than two confirmed people is not an event
 *     with too few players, it is not an event. Filling it would produce a tournament a single
 *     person "wins" against machines, which is worse than not running it.
 *  2. **Only where bots were published.** `allowBots` must be on AND the ruleset must admit bots at
 *     all. Bots have no precedent in the official rules, so an official preset refuses them even if
 *     the flag were somehow set: a competitive event short of players takes byes and no-shows.
 *  3. **Never displace a person.** The plan is expressed as a count of bots to ADD; nothing here
 *     can remove, reorder or replace a confirmed human.
 *  4. **Never an illegal deck.** With no legal deck for the block, no bot is seated at all; the
 *     event runs short rather than seating a bot the server would reject at deal time.
