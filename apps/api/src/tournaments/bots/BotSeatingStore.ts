/**
 * Seats the bots that complete a short field, once and only at the close of check-in.
 *
 * "Once" is the hard part, and it is enforced by looking for bot participants before planning any:
 * a tournament that already has one is left exactly as it is. That makes the whole operation safe
 * to retry after a partial failure and safe for two API containers to attempt at the same time,
 * because the plan is derived under the tournament's row lock.
 *
 * A seated bot is an ordinary participant row in every respect the rest of the system cares about:
 * `status='active'` and a `deck_snapshot` copied in place, exactly like a human's frozen deck. Room
 * seating therefore reads one column for every participant and has no bot-shaped branch at all.
 * `bot_profile` and `bot_deck_version` are the provenance of that snapshot, not a second source of
 * truth for it.
 *
 * Shares the AccountStore's pool and migration run rather than opening a second one.
