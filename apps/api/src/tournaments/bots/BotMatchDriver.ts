 * for an authorization for exactly the next game, and redeems that authorization to take a seat.
 * There is no bypass anywhere in it — take the series module away and the driver can do nothing.
 *
 * It handles both shapes a bot-involved confrontation takes:
 *
 *  - **Human versus bot** — the person joins through the ordinary Colyseus flow, and the bot takes
 *    the other seat of the same room. The room starts once both seats are filled.
 *  - **Bot versus bot** — both seats are driven here and the confrontation runs unattended, with no
 *    client connected at any point.
 *
 * Everything it does is idempotent against the persisted state, so a driver restarted mid-series
 * picks the confrontation up where it was rather than replaying it: presence is
 * first-arrival-wins, an authorization only ever names the next unfinished game, and a game already
 * bound to a room is re-entered rather than re-created.
