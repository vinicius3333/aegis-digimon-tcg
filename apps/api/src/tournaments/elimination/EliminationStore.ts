/**
 * The single-elimination bracket for a program tournament.
 *
 * Two things separate it from the legacy bracket in `AccountStore`, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **A seat is a PARTICIPANT, not an Account.** That is what lets a bot occupy one. The account
 *    columns are still written for human seats, because presence, room tickets and the
 *    participant-facing views all read them, so a human seat carries both identities and a bot seat
 *    only the participant one.
 *  - **Every row belongs to a PHASE.** `tournament_matches` is shared with the Swiss program, which
 *    writes its own pairings into the same table. Scoping every read and every write by a phase of
 *    kind `single_elimination` is what stops this module from ever seeing — let alone overwriting —
 *    a published Swiss pairing. `resolveMatch` re-checks the phase kind of the match it was handed
 *    rather than trusting the caller, because the caller is a resolution listener that is told about
 *    EVERY confrontation in the system, Swiss ones included.
 *
 * Two invariants the module exists to protect:
 *
 *  - **A published pairing is never rewritten.** Creating a bracket that already exists returns the
 *    existing one; resolving a match that is already finished changes nothing. Every write restates
 *    the status it expected to find, so a retry cannot advance a winner twice.
 *  - **The draw is reproducible.** The seed is persisted and everything derived from it is pure
 *    (see `bracket.ts`), so re-reading after a restart yields the bracket that was published.
 *
 * Standings project from `tournament_result_ledger`, the same table the Swiss program writes, so an
 * elimination event has standings for the same reason a Swiss one does. The pure {@link ledger}
 * projection is a convenience for reading a bracket back; the TABLE is the source of truth.
 *
 * Shares the AccountStore's pool and migration run rather than opening a second one.

   *    with nothing to notice, and the column exists precisely so the draw is explainable from the
   *    database alone. Reading it makes the persisted value load-bearing.
   *  - **The caller's transaction and lock.** The freeze, the seeds and the bracket are one atomic
   *    act; splitting them would leave a snapshot with no bracket, or a bracket drawn from seeds a
   *    concurrent write had already changed. The caller holds the tournament lock, so this must not
