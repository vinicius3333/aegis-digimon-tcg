/**
 * The Swiss lifecycle: freeze the structure, publish rounds, write the ledger, project standings,
 * and decide what happens when the last planned round closes.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * **Standings are always a projection of `tournament_result_ledger`, never a counter.** Nothing in
 * this module increments a stored score. A PLAYED match becomes ledger rows in one sweep at round
 * close; a bye is ledgered at publication instead, because a bye is decided the moment it is
 * awarded and nobody has to turn up for it. Both are keyed `(tournament, participant, round)`, so
 * the sweep is safe to run any number of times, and standings are recomputed from the whole ledger
 * on every read.
 *
 * **A round is published atomically or not at all.** The round row, every match of it, and every
 * match's `join_deadline_at` are written in one transaction — and {@link SwissProgram.mutate} rolls
 * that transaction back on a returned failure as well as a thrown one, so a refusal leaves the
 * database exactly as it found it and the retry sees the same world the first attempt did.
 *
 * Every command is idempotent, because the same commands are called from the result path, from
 * {@link SwissProgram.sweepOpenTournaments}, and from an organizer's manual nudge; none may
 * double-apply anything.
 *
 * **Known limit: `needs_organizer_decision` is a dead end until the arbitration slice lands.** A
 * confrontation that timed out tied in elimination, or whose series voided, has no result this
 * module may invent, so its round can never close. The sweep skips such rounds silently rather than
 * retrying them into an error log every tick; clearing them needs the judge commands slice 8 adds.
