 *
 * ## The attendance timeline
 *
 * All three attendance numbers are offsets from ONE origin: the moment the round was published,
 * when the confrontation became playable. The queue does not store that origin — it stores the
 * `join_deadline_at` the round publisher wrote and the UI counts down to — so this module derives
 * it back out: `base = join_deadline_at - joinGraceMs`. All three values come from the same frozen
 * snapshot, so the derivation cannot disagree with the value it inverts.
 *
 *     base ──── joinGraceMs ────▶ join_deadline_at
 *     base ──── gameLossAtMs ───▶ game-loss rung
 *     base ──── matchLossAtMs ──▶ match-loss rung
 *
 * With the pinned presets (grace = game loss = 5 min, match loss = 10 min) the game-loss rung
 * lands exactly on `join_deadline_at` and the match loss five minutes later, which is the manual's
 * "game loss at 5 minutes late, match loss at 10". Reading the penalties as offsets from
 * `join_deadline_at` instead would put them at 10 and 15 minutes, which is the misreading this
 * derivation exists to make impossible.

/**
 * The clock an administratively created series runs on, chosen by the match's PHASE.
 *
 * A confrontation that has to be created by a deadline — a double no-show has no presence to have
 * started one — must run under the same clock the players would have started it under. Reading the
 * phase is what makes a Top Cut match 55 minutes and the final untimed instead of everything
 * silently taking the Swiss round clock.
 *
 * A match that cannot be read at all falls back to the base round duration: the caller is about to
 * refuse the row as a missing subject anyway, and inventing an untimed series in the meantime would
 * be the worse guess.
