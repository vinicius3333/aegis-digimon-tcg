/**
 * The seam between the Swiss phase and its Top Cut.
 *
 * It lives in neither of the modules it joins, and deliberately. `SwissProgram` may not depend on a
 * bracket — it would then have to know how a bracket is drawn to end an event. `EliminationStore`
 * may not depend on standings — `bracket.ts` says so in as many words, because a bracket that
 * re-derived its seeding from a mutable projection would draw a different cut every time it was
 * re-read. This module is what knows both, and it is the only thing that does.
 *
 * ## What one transition is
 *
 * Everything below happens in ONE transaction, under the tournament's lock:
 *
 *  1. the final Swiss standings are projected one last time and PERSISTED, row by row, into
 *     `tournament_standings_snapshots`;
 *  2. the eligible participants are picked off that order, top down;
 *  3. their cut seeds, 1..N, are written onto `tournament_participants.top_cut_seed`;
 *  4. the Top Cut phase is drawn from exactly those seeds, mirrored (1 × N, 2 × N-1, …);
 *  5. the Swiss phase moves from `frozen` to `finished`.
 *
 * They commit together because none of them means anything alone. A snapshot with no bracket is a
 * frozen order nobody used; a bracket with no snapshot is a cut with no evidence; seeds written
 * without either are a bracket the next re-read would draw differently.
 *
 * ## Why the snapshot is stored rather than re-projected
 *
 * Standings are a projection of `tournament_result_ledger`, and the Top Cut writes its OWN ledger
 * rows as it is played. Re-projecting after the cut therefore no longer yields the order the cut
 * was made from — the cut's wins and losses are mixed into it. The snapshot is the immutable
 * evidence of the decision, and it records `eligible` and `cut_seed` alongside the numbers so the
 * question "why is the ninth-placed player in the Top 8?" is answerable from the stored rows alone.
 *
 * ## Eligibility and the cut line
 *
 * "The first `topCutSize` ELIGIBLE participants" (implementation plan, "Entrada no Top Cut"): a
 * participant who dropped or was disqualified keeps their standings row — their results are real
 * and their opponents' tiebreakers depend on them — but they cannot be seated in a bracket they
 * have left, so the walk skips them and the next eligible player moves up. `topCutSize` itself is
 * never resized: it was frozen from the confirmed field at check-in close, and a later drop must
 * not shrink or grow the cut.
 *
 * There is no play-in for a tie at the cut line. `computeStandings` produces a TOTAL order — points,
 * then the ruleset's criteria, then registration seed, then participant id — so the boundary between
 * 8th and 9th is always decided, and it is decided by the same rule that decides every other
 * position. The two players' records may be identical; their standings positions are not.
 *
 * ## Idempotency and what actually serializes the callers
 *
 * The transition is reached from three places — the round-close notification, the sweep, and the
 * organizer's manual nudge — and they will race.
 *
 * **The row lock is the guarantee.** `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the tournament is taken as the first
 * act of the transaction and held to commit, so a second caller blocks there and finds the Top Cut
 * phase already created when it proceeds. The in-process lock is only an optimisation, and only
 * between callers that share THIS instance — which is why `index.ts` passes the runtime singleton
 * into the routes rather than letting them construct their own. Across processes (blue/green, more
 * than one API instance) it does nothing at all, and the row lock is doing all the work.
 *
 * Behind it, every step still restates what it expects to find: the snapshot's unique index makes a
 * second freeze insert nothing, an existing Top Cut phase short-circuits the whole thing, and the
 * seed write is by value rather than by increment.
 *
 * ## Known limit: a drop DURING the cut stalls its bracket
 *
 * Eligibility is decided once, at the freeze. A player who drops after being seated has no bracket
 * effect at all: their confrontation stays `pending`, nobody advances, and the round waits. That is
 * deliberate — a bracket is not a Swiss round and cannot simply re-pair around an absence, and
 * awarding the win automatically would let a concession decide a title with nothing audited. The
 * resolution is the arbitration slice's judge commands (disqualify / award), landing in a parallel
 * branch; until then the attendance ladder's no-show path is what moves such a match, and anything
 * it cannot settle parks on `needs_organizer_decision` by design.
