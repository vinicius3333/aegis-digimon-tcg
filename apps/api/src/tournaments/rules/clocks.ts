 * cannot answer the question three subtly different ways and start the same confrontation under two
 * different clocks depending on who arrived first.

/**
 * How long a confrontation runs before its deadline fires: the phase's round clock PLUS the
 * ruleset's overtime.
 *
 * `null` means untimed — the official preset's final is exactly that, and `SeriesStore` supports it
 * by queuing no deadline and replaying drawn games until one decides.
 *
 * The bracket branch falls back from the cut clock to the final's rather than to the Swiss one: a
 * plain single-elimination event has no Swiss phase at all, so its rounds are elimination rounds and
 * the Swiss clock would be borrowed from a format it never runs.
 *
 * **Why overtime is folded in here.** Manual §5.2 gives a round its time and then a fixed number of
 * further turns; the deadline this feeds (`SeriesStore.createSeries` → `now + duration`) is the
 * instant the confrontation is DECIDED, not the instant the main clock stops. Returning the round
 * clock alone would settle a 45-minute Swiss round at 45 minutes and skip the extra turns entirely.
 * Adding `overtimeMs` puts the decision at 45 + 5, which is where the manual puts it.
 *
 * What is NOT modelled here is what happens INSIDE those five minutes: turn 0 plus three or five
 * extra turns, and the elimination state-tiebreak chain, are in-game semantics the room does not yet
 * expose. Per the plan's risk section, an elimination confrontation that reaches the deadline tied
 * still escalates to `needs_organizer_decision` rather than being settled by a metric nobody can
 * read. This function only decides WHEN the question is asked.
