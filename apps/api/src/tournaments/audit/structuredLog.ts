/**
 * The grep-able half of the audit trail.
 *
 * The implementation plan asks for structured logs carrying `tournamentId`, `phaseId`, `roundId`,
 * `matchId`, `seriesId`, `commandId` and `reasonCode`, and explicitly no decklists and no tokens.
 * One JSON object per line is the whole design: counters ("no-shows this hour", "deadlines late")
 * are derived by grepping the stream, so nothing here depends on a metrics backend existing, and
 * adding one later means pointing a collector at the same lines.
 *
 * Only the fields below are ever emitted. That is the privacy rule expressed as a type rather than
 * as a review comment: there is no `extra` bag a caller could put a decklist in.
