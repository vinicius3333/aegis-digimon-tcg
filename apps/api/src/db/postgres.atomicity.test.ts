/**
 * The transaction lane, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * **Why this file exists.** Every other database test in the tree runs on pg-mem, which does not
 * implement ROLLBACK: it applies the statements of a rolled-back transaction anyway. So the suite's
 * atomicity claims are asserted on the VERB — "the module issued ROLLBACK" — and never on the
 * outcome, because asserting the surviving rows there would pin the fake's bug rather than the
 * module's behaviour (see the comments in `SwissProgram.test.ts`, which say exactly this). That is
 * the right call for a test that must run everywhere, and it leaves one thing unverified: whether a
 * rolled-back command actually leaves the database as it found it. This file verifies that, and
 * nothing else — it is deliberately a handful of scenarios, not a second copy of the suite.
 *
 * **How to run it.** It is its own lane, excluded from the default `pnpm test` by
 * `vitest.config.ts` unless `POSTGRES_TESTS=1`, so a machine with no database does not collect it
 * at all rather than reporting five permanently pending tests:
 *
 * ```bash
 * docker run --rm -d -p 55432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aegis --name aegis-pg postgres:16
 * POSTGRES_TEST_URL=postgres://postgres:aegis@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres \
 *   pnpm --filter @aegis/api test:postgres
 * docker rm -f aegis-pg
 * ```
 *
 * Any reachable Postgres works: point `POSTGRES_TEST_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) at it. Opting in
 * without a connection string is an error, not a skip, so the lane cannot pass by doing nothing.
 * There is no CI job wired to it yet.
 *
 * **Why plain `pg` and not testcontainers.** The value of this lane is real Postgres transaction
 * semantics, not container lifecycle management. `pg` is already a runtime dependency; testcontainers
 * would add a dev dependency and a Docker client to replace the one `docker run` line above, and
 * would still refuse to run where Docker is unavailable. Adding a dependency to arrive at the same
 * skip is not worth it.
 *
 * Each run works inside its own schema and drops it afterwards, so the lane is safe to point at a
 * scratch database and leaves nothing behind.
