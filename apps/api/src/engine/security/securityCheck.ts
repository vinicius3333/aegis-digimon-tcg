/**
 * Security check resolution: the heart of security-and-win-check.
 *
 * Subsystem: security-and-win-check.
 * Source: documented behavior `ISecurityCheck.SecurityCheck()` (the flip-and-resolve
 * loop), documented behavior `IBattle` (battle vs the revealed security Digimon),
 * documented behavior `DetermineAttackOutcome` (the empty-security loss check), and
 * documented behavior `Strike` (how many security cards a single attack checks).
 *
 * Behaviour implemented (presentation UI / animation / coroutine yields stripped):
 *   1. Strike == 0 => no check happens at all.
 *   2. A player-directed attack with Strike >= 1 into EMPTY security => the
 *      attacker's controller wins immediately (loss = "security").
 *   3. Otherwise loop up to `Strike` times while security cards remain:
 *      a. take the top security card (security[0]), reveal it (faceUp = true) and
 *         announce the reveal (`securityRevealed`) before anything it causes,
 *      b. remove the checked card into its temporary no-area context,
 *      c. run its immediate [Security] effect, then the simultaneous check/removal pool,
 *      d. if the checked card is still a Security Digimon, battle the attacker,
 *      e. move the checked card to trash unless an effect relocated it,
 *      f. stop early if the attacker has left play.
 *
 * The immediate Security effect precedes other activations: CR 15-16-10-2 — "a triggered [Security]
 * effect will immediately activate without pending activation. Therefore, [Security]
 * effects take precedence for activation even when they trigger simultaneously with
 * other effects" — confirmed by KB Q6085/Q2221.
 *
 * Removal and its watchers precede the battle (Comprehensive Rules 13-1-6: "a checked card is
 * removed from the security stack" happens at the check; the battle is the later
 * 13-1-8-3 step). So an attacker deleted BY the battle still fires its
 * whenSecurityRemoved watchers (e.g. BT14-001's inherited ＜Draw 1＞), while one removed
 * by the [Security] effect does not (KB Q2611/Q2629).
 *
 * Reveal, OnSecurityCheck, OnLoseSecurity and security-removal watchers share one pending
 * activation pool. The engine snapshots eligibility before the immediate Security effect,
 * then permits controller ordering across all families (Q4284, CR 15-4-3-5).
 *
 * The pieces this subsystem does not own — firing the effect stack at a timing
 * window, activating a card's [Security] effect, and the concrete deletePermanent
 * primitive — are injected as `SecurityCheckDeps` so this control flow is complete
 * and testable now, and the real implementations (effect-stack-resolution,
 * effect-framework, effect-primitives) plug in without touching this file.
