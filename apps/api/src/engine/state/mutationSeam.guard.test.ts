/**
 * Guard: the ONLY place allowed to mutate a zone array directly is the mutation seam
 * (state/access.ts). Every other engine file must move cards through the seam's
 * exported functions (insertCard/extractCardById/takeTop/…), so zone-mutation
 * invariants have exactly one home. Mirrors the repo's regen:check convention:
 * drift becomes a build failure, not a silent leak.
 *
 * Ratchet: `MIGRATION_PENDING` lists files not yet routed through the seam. Offenders
 * must be a subset of it. Remove a file from the set as it is migrated; when the set
 * is empty and no offenders remain, the seam is fully enforced. A new raw mutation in
 * an already-migrated (or brand-new) file fails immediately.
 *
 * The set is now empty: the seam is fully enforced. Any raw zone push/splice/shift
 * outside state/access.ts is a build failure — route it through the seam instead.
