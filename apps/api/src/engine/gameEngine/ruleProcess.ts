 * chunk verified against `node tools/kb/query.mjs rules "rule check"`):
 *
 *   - §17-1-3-1-1 (delete): a battle-area Digimon at raw DP 0.
 *   - §17-1-3-2-1 (trash):  a battle-area Digimon at raw DP < 0 ("without DP").
 *   - §17-1-3-2-3 (trash):  a non-Digimon/non-DigiEgg card in the breeding slot.
 *   - §17-1-3-2-4 (trash):  a permanent whose TOP card is face-down.
 *   - §17-1-3-2-5 (trash):  linked cards beyond a Digimon's effective link limit.
 *   - §17-1-3-2-6/§17-1-3-2-7 (trash): a linked card whose own compiled `linkRequirement`
 *     (names/traits) the live host no longer satisfies.
 *   - §17-1-3-2-2 (trash): an Option-kind battle-area permanent NOT placed there by an
 *     effect (`Permanent.placedByEffect`, packages/shared — set by the one path that
 *     creates an Option permanent, `placeOptionAsPermanent` in effects/primitives.ts).
 *
 * plus the EndGame loss-flag resolution (Ch.18, run first each pass, mirroring the
 * source `AutoProcessCheck` ordering). Deliberately NOT implemented: "Battle as Tamer"
 * (no such rule located in Chapter 17 or elsewhere).
 *
 * All deletion routes through the existing `deletePermanent` primitive with cause
 * `byRule`, keeping OnDeletion + leave-prevention (and the now-live `onDeletionOf` bus)
 * single-sourced (RESEARCH "Don't Hand-Roll"); the link-excess trim routes through the
 * `trash` primitive (a link card is trashed individually, not the whole permanent).
 *
 * PRECONDITION (invariant, not enforced here): the continuous DP tier must already be
 * current when engine runs. `doRuleProcess()` -> anyZeroDpDigimon()/anyNegativeDpToTrash()
 * read `modifiers.rawDp` directly and do NOT recompute first; they rely on the caller to
 * have refreshed the continuous layer (every wired caller reaches engine sandwiched inside a
 * `fireTiming` window, after `recomputeContinuousEffects`). A future DIRECT caller, or a
 * call reached outside a `fireTiming` window, MUST `await recomputeContinuousEffects()`
 * before entering, otherwise a stale `rawDp` could wrongly delete a Digimon a static
 * `[Your Turn] +N DP` would have lifted above 0, or miss one a cleared buff should drop to 0.
 * Do NOT call engine while the continuous ledger is mid-clear.
 *
 * §17-1-2 note: rule checks aren't performed during rule processing (§17-1-2-1) or
 * during effect processing (§17-1-2-2). The `ruleProcessing` latch below satisfies
 * §17-1-2-1 (a re-entrant call, e.g. from an [On Deletion] triggered BY engine sweep's own
 * deletePermanent, returns false from `doRuleProcess` until engine pass finishes). §17-1-2-2
 * is satisfied by construction of `resolveTiming` (stack.ts): the sweep runs only before a
 * timing window starts and after each single triggered effect FULLY resolves — never
 * between two instructions inside one effect's own body, matching the rule's own worked
 * example (a "-3000 DP and <Security A. -1>" effect is checked only after BOTH clauses
 * apply). A timing window opened by a rule-produced movement cannot start a second sweep:
 * the active outer fixpoint owns the rule work and the pending triggers until it converges.
