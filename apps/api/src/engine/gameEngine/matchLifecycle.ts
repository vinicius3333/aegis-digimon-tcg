 *
 * The client deck is attacker-controlled, so it is validated against the
 * deck-construction rules (50 main + ≤5 eggs, per-card copy limits, banlist
 * single-card restrictions) BEFORE anything is staged. An illegal deck throws,
 * which propagates out of {@link AegisRoom.onJoin} as a Colyseus seat rejection;
 * neither {@link PlayerState} nor the staged decklist is created for the seat.
 *
 * A fully-empty deck (`mainDeck` and `eggDeck` both empty) is the headless
 * board-setup sentinel used by engine unit tests that hand-build the board and
 * never run {@link startMatch}; it bypasses validation. A real client join always
 * sends a populated deck, and the 50-card size rule rejects an empty deck for
