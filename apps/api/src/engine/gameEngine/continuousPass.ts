/**
 * Re-derive every continuous (persistent / `EffectTiming.None`) effect from a clean
 * slate (subsystem: static-continuous-effects). Comprehensive Rules §15-8-2:
 * persistent effects ("[Your Turn] This Digimon gets +1000 DP", "can't attack", a
 * granted ＜Blocker＞, a continuous cost reduction) are "constantly activated without
 * being triggered" — there is no firing window, so the engine recomputes the whole
 * tier at each relevant decision point.
 *
 * Clear-then-recompute (so nothing double-applies): drop only the CONTINUOUS tier of
 * both ledgers (the `continuous`-tagged DP/pierce/evo/play-cost modifiers and the
 * `continuous`-tagged restrictions/keywords/aliases/waivers) — one-shot,
 * duration-scoped modifiers from triggered effects are untouched — then re-fire the
 * `None`-timing effects with `continuousMode` on, so each re-records itself as
 * `continuous`. Unlike a triggered window engine does NOT touch the per-turn use ledger
 * and never prompts (persistent effects are mandatory and make no choices); a static
 * effect whose own `when`/`condition` gate fails simply contributes nothing engine pass,
 * which is exactly how a `[Your Turn]`/`while ...` effect lapses when its gate stops
 * holding.
 *
 * Re-entrant calls from inside the continuous pass are no-ops. Concurrent requests from a
 * different async flow instead wait for the in-flight pass and queue one final refresh. That
 * completion barrier prevents consumers from observing the clear-before-refill interval of
 * the continuous ledgers. Public so callers/tests can force a recompute at a decision point
 * the timing/boundary hooks do not already cover.
