 * Match setup: build each seat's zones from its decklist and run the official
 * pre-game procedure (subsystem: deck-and-setup; source: Comprehensive Rules §5-2
 * "Pre-Game Preparations", reproduced in tools/kb rules).
 *
 * The KB §5-2-1 sequence this implements, in order:
 *   1. §5-2-1-1  shuffle the deck (face down),
 *   2. §5-2-1-2  shuffle the Digi-Egg deck,
 *   3. §5-2-1-3  decide the first/second player,
 *   4. §5-2-1-4  each draws 5 for their opening hand,
 *   5. §5-2-1-4/5 each may redraw (mulligan) once — return hand, shuffle, draw 5,
 *   6. §5-2-1-6  set the top 5 cards of the deck as the face-down security stack
 *                (the top card of the deck becomes the BOTTOM of the security stack),
 *   7. §5-2-1-7  place the memory gauge at 0,
 *   8. §5-2-1-8  the game begins with the first player's turn.
 *
 * Everything here mutates only the passed schema instances and is driven by an
 * injected, seeded PRNG so a match is fully reproducible from one seed (API-CONTRACT
 * §7 "Determinism": the seed is server-only; clients see counts, never order). The
 * engine owns *when* mulligan/first-player are decided (they need a client round
 * trip); this module owns the deterministic mechanics each decision triggers.
