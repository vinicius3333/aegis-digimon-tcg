 *   - the dealt state per the rulebook (§5-2): hand = 5, security = 5, egg deck = 5,
 *     deck = 50 - 5 - 5, memory = 0, a first player chosen,

 * breeding/main windows await client input), so the test feeds intents and flushes
 * the microtask queue between steps, exactly as the room would relay them.
