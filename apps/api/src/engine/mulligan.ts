/**
 * The opening-hand mulligan window (subsystem: deck-and-setup; source: Comprehensive
 * Rules §5-2-1-4/5 "re-draw"). After opening hands are dealt, each player — STARTING
 * WITH THE FIRST PLAYER — may declare a single redraw of their hand.
 *
 * Unlike the in-game decisions routed through DecisionManager, the mulligan is
 * answered by its own dedicated `mulligan` intent (API-CONTRACT §4; DecisionManager
 * deliberately does not match `mulligan`). This small coordinator owns that window:
 *   - {@link request} opens the window for one seat: it mirrors a `mulligan`
 *     PendingDecision into synchronized state (so the client sees the prompt and the
 *     "only respond while a decision is open" gate is consistent), sends the
 *     DecisionRequest to that seat, and returns a promise.
 *   - {@link answer} is called when that seat's `mulligan` intent arrives: it clears
 *     the pending state and resolves the promise with the keep/redraw choice.
 *
 * Only one mulligan is open at a time (the engine sequences the seats, first player
 * first). {@link cancel} unwinds an open window (match torn down mid-setup) so the
 * awaiting setup code does not leak.
