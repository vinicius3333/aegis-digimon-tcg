 * candidate effects: each player's field permanents, hand, trash, and face-up
 * security, for BOTH players (turn order applied later). The engine supplies that
 * candidate list via `listCandidateInstances` so this module does not encode
 * GameState's zone layout; the framework's `gatherTriggeredEffects` applies the
