/**
 * Continuous-effect application layer (subsystem: static-continuous-effects).
 *
 * Some card text does not perform a one-shot mutation but imposes an ongoing
 * RULE while the source is in play (or for a bounded duration): a Digimon that
 * "can't attack", an "attack target can't change", a name/trait alias ("also
 * treated as [X]"), or a permission ("use this card without meeting its color
 * requirements"). source these are queried at decision points (can-attack,
 * can-change-target, name comparison, color-cost check) rather than stored as a
 * stat. This ledger is the server-only store the engine's combat / turn / cost
 * code reads at those points.
 *
 * Scope (consistent with the `core` effect-primitives sibling, modifiers.ts): it
 * OWNS the continuous-rule store and the boundary sweep. It does NOT itself drive
 * combat/turn legality — the consumers (combat legality, attack target change,
 * card-name comparison, color-cost check) read it. Recording a rule is therefore a
 * REAL effect (authoritative server state survives until its boundary), not a
 * silent no-op; the read sites are documented TODOs where not yet wired.
 *
 * Pairs with ModifierLedger: that one owns numeric DP/pierce/evo-cost windows; this
 * one owns boolean restrictions, name/trait aliases, and color-cost waivers. They
 * share the same DurationBoundary sweep contract so the engine clears both at once.
 */
