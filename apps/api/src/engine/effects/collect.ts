 *
 * The projection re-times effects rather than copying them: each candidate source is asked for
 * the SAME effects it would contribute at `OnDestroyedAnyone`, and they are reported at the
 * end-of-attack window instead. Two properties fall out of that and are the reason it is done
 * this way rather than through a granted-token library entry:
 *
 *  - Inherited `[On Deletion]` effects are reached, because a permanent's digivolution cards are
 *    candidate sources exactly as its top card is (KB Q2614's EX4-053 / Q2615's BT13-014).
 *  - Each projected effect keeps its own trigger condition and the inherited/printed placement
 *    guard `canActivate` applies, so a stack card's OWN printed `[On Deletion]` is not projected
 *    and a conditional inherited effect whose condition is unmet is collected-but-not-activatable
 *    — which is precisely Q2614's answer ("the effect will trigger, but it can't be activated").
 *
 * `onDeletion`'s base guard is permissive when the firing window carries no deleted set, which an
 * end-of-attack window never does; the caller is responsible for scoping the projection to the
 * attacking permanent.
