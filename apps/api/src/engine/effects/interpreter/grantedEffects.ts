// Granted named-effect library (GrantStatic grant:"effects" with tokens)

/**
 * The built-in effects a `grantCustomEffect` token confers. Each token resolves to an IR
 * `CardEffect`, compiled on demand to a real Effect anchored on the GRANTED permanent (the
 * recipient of the grant), so the granted ability fires through the same EffectTiming window
 * and trigger gate as a printed effect — never a parallel/inert path.
 *
 * A token normally resolves to one `CardEffect`; a keyword such as Execute can resolve to
 * multiple timing effects that share one idempotent ledger entry. Every token actually
 * installed by a `ctx.fx.grantCustomEffect` call site (audited across
 * `apps/api/src/cards/**`) MUST have an entry here — see `grantedTokenEffectsForTiming`'s
 * loud failure for an unknown token, added alongside this library so a new call site with a
 * typo'd or unregistered token is a crash, not a silent no-op (this class of bug: BT5-091's
 * "[When Attacking] Lose 1 memory." token sat here unconsumed for the granted effect's whole
 * lifetime before this fix).
 *
 * `OnDeletionDeleteLowest` — RB1-030's "[On Deletion] Delete 1 of your opponent's Digimon with
 * the lowest level" (documented behavior: an OnDestroyedAnyone rule implementation whose target is
 * `IsPermanentExistsOnOpponentBattleAreaDigimon` ∧ `IsMinLevel(enemy)`). The Delete target's
 * `superlative:"lowestLevel"` narrows the opponent's battle-area Digimon pool to minimum printed
 * level (ties: all extrema), matching IsMinLevel.
 *
 * `OnDeletionLose1Memory` — a generic "[On Deletion] Lose 1 memory" grant (not currently
 * installed by any card; kept as a library primitive other future ports can reuse).
 *
 * `[When Attacking] Lose 1 memory.` — BT5-091 Takumi Aiba's "[All Turns] all level 3 Digimon
 * gain '[When Attacking] Lose 1 memory'" (KB Q1369/Q1370: fires on the granted Digimon's own
 * attack; two copies of the granting Tamer are separate activations). The literal printed-text
 * string is the token (BT5-091 has no shorter semantic name for it).
 *
 * `OnDeletionPlaySelfNoOnPlay` — BT3-109's "[On Deletion] Play back without cost, [On Play]
 * effects don't activate" grant (a Black Option's [Main]: 1 of your Digimon gains this for the
 * turn). `suppressOnPlayEffects` skips the played permanent's own [On Play] window — this is
 * the ONE library entry that needs it (the others playing themselves back, below, do NOT
 * suppress [On Play]).
 *
 * `OnPlayBlitzIfHasDigivolutionCard` — BT9-102's granted "[On Play] If this Digimon has a
 * digivolution card, ＜Blitz＞" (printed text granted to Digimon already on the field; per
 * Comprehensive Rules §16-16 <Blitz> lets the granted Digimon attack while the opponent has
 * memory — a keyword grant `[On Play]`-timed and re-evaluated should the granted Digimon later
 * re-enter as a new card this turn, e.g. via a bounce-and-replay).
 *
 * `OnDeletionPlaySelf` — EX4-059 Jijimon's "[On Deletion] You may play this card without paying
 * the cost" grant ([When Digivolving]: this Digimon and 1 of your level <=5 Digimon gain it
 * until opponent's turn end). `optional: true` — "you MAY play".
 *
 * The following four entries are keyed by the LITERAL printed granted-effect text (the RB1-030
 * "quotedEffect" convention, not a semantic slug) because the `GrantAuraToOpponents` malformed-
 * shape route above (Q1f) supplies `action.effectText` verbatim as the token, and that text is
 * the only thing the compiler recovers deterministically for these clauses:
 *
 * `"[On Deletion] Lose 1 memory."` — BT15-068, BT20-065, BT9-014's granted "1 of your
 * opponent's Digimon gains '[On Deletion] Lose 1 memory.'". Same body as the semantic
 * `OnDeletionLose1Memory` entry above; kept as a separate key rather than reused because the
 * two entries are addressed by different call sites (a hand-authored module choosing the
 * semantic name vs. the generic malformed-shape route echoing the printed text back).
 *
 * `"[On Deletion] Lose 2 memory"` — BT6-102's "1 of your opponent's Digimon gains '[On
 * Deletion] Lose 2 memory' until the end of their next turn."
 *
 * `"[On Deletion] Gain 3 memory."` — BT11-106's "1 of your Digimon ... gains '[On Deletion]
 * Gain 3 memory.'" (granted to the CONTROLLER's own Digimon, not the opponent's — the amount
 * is positive because the grantee's own owner gains memory on its own deletion).
 *
 * Q1f second pass — more literal-printed-text entries, same convention (every "your"/"this
 * Digimon" in the granted text resolves relative to the GRANTED permanent's own owner/self,
 * never the granter):
 *
 * `"[On Deletion] Trash the top card of your security stack."` — BT12-105/BT15-095's granted
 * "1 of your opponent's Digimon gains ...". `SecurityManipulation`'s `controller` defaults to
 * `ctx.source.ownerSeat` when omitted (`runSecurityManipulation`: `seat = action.controller ===
 * "opponent" ? opp : mine`), so leaving it unset makes the GRANTEE trash their own top security
 * — matching KB Q2241 (deleting the grantee mid-attack, before its own security check, can drop
 * its security count to 0 and win the game).
 *
 * `"[When Attacking] Lose 2 memory"` — EX1-068/EX4-018's granted "1 of your opponent's Digimon
 * gains ...". Same body as `"[When Attacking] Lose 1 memory."` above at a different magnitude;
 * KB Q3255 confirms the OPPONENT (the grantee's own controller) loses the memory, matching
 * `GainMemory`'s seatless form resolving via `ctx.source.ownerSeat`.
 *
 * `"[On Deletion] Trash 1 card in your hand."` — EX8-059's granted "1 of your opponent's Digimon
 * gains ...". "your hand" = the grantee's own hand (self-referential), mirroring the card's own
 * unrelated `[When Attacking]` `Trash` clause shape (`{controller:"mine", zone:"hand"}`).
 *
 * `"[When Attacking] Trash the bottom digivolution card of this Digimon."` — BT8-031's granted
 * "All of your opponent's Digimon gain ..." (the outer `[Opponent's Turn]` wrapper only gates
 * WHEN the grant is (re-)installed each continuous recompute — idempotent — not the granted
 * body's own timing, which is the ordinary discrete `WhenAttacking` window).
 *
 * `"[End of Attack] Delete this Digimon."` — EX7-058/EX6-048's granted "1 of your opponent's
 * Digimon gains ...". `EndOfAttack` maps to the discrete `EffectTiming.OnEndAttack` window
 * (`timingForTrigger`), so this reaches the grantee exactly once, at that Digimon's own
 * attack's end.
 *
 * `"[Start of Your Main Phase] Attack with this Digimon."` and `"[Start of Your Main Phase]
 * This Digimon attacks."` — two literal printed phrasings of the same forced-self-attack grant
 * (BT12-107; BT16-058/BT18-099/EX6-042/ST15-16/BT23-032/P-183), kept as separate keys per the
 * literal-text convention. `StartOfYourMainPhase` maps to the discrete `EffectTiming
 * .OnStartMainPhase` window (fired by `fireTiming` for every candidate instance, `turnOwnerGuard`
 * gating it to the GRANTEE's own main phase) — distinct from, but sitting alongside, the System B
 * `startOfYourMainPhase` SubTrigger bus `fireTiming` ALSO fires at the same physical point
 * (GameEngine.ts:1263) for the unrelated hand-installed-SubTrigger encoding BT12-065 uses; either
 * mechanism reaches the same instant, and the discrete library route needs no SubTrigger install
 * at all.
