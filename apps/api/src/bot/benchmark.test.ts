/**
 * Bot-vs-bot benchmark.
 *
 * Two sizes, one code path:
 *   - the SMOKE series always runs. It is small enough to sit inside the normal suite and
 *     is there to catch regressions in kind — an illegal action, a thrown error, a wedged
 *     match — not to measure strength precisely.
 *   - the FULL series runs only under `BOT_BENCH=1`. It is the one whose winrate and
 *     behavior numbers are quoted, because a handful of games is pure noise on a game
 *     with this much variance.
 *
 * Every match is seeded from a fixed base seed, and each series alternates which
 * configuration sits in seat 0, so first-player advantage cancels rather than being
 * measured as skill.
