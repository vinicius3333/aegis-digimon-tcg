/**
 * Bot personalities, expressed purely as data.
 *
 * Every profile drives the SAME evaluation function (`evaluate.ts`); a personality is
 * a set of weights and thresholds, never a code branch. Adding a personality therefore
 * means adding an entry here, and a behavior difference between two personalities is
 * always explainable as a weight difference.
 *
 * Units: one point is roughly "one memory". A weight multiplies a quantity already
 * normalised into those points (see `bodyValue` in `evaluate.ts`).
