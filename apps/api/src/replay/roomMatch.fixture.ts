/**
 * Plays a real {@link AegisRoom} match and keeps every log line the room wrote.
 *
 * Seat 0 is a person: a fake Colyseus client that joins through `onJoin`, sends `ready` and every
 * later intent through the room's own client path (`handleIntent`), chats, and can drop and come
 * back through `onLeave`. A {@link BotPlayer} decides its moves. Seat 1 is the room's own bot,
 * seated by `addBot`. Time is faked, so the bots' think delays and the room's timeouts (the
 * combat-window answer timeout included) elapse instantly but in their real order.
 *
 * With `clock: "real"` nothing is faked: the room is initialised the way Colyseus' matchmaker
 * creates one (`room.__init()` before `onCreate`, `MatchMaker.mjs` `handleCreateRoom`), so the
 * room's own `patchRate` interval calls `broadcastPatch()` every 50 ms, which ticks the room
 * clock at whatever async boundary it lands on, exactly as in production. The bots still think
 * for seconds per action then; a test that uses the real clock shortens their pacing itself.
