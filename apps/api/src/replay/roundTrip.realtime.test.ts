/**
 * The round trip of `roundTrip.test.ts`, with the room on Node's real timers instead of faked
 * ones. In production Colyseus' matchmaker calls `room.__init()` before `onCreate`; that arms
 * `setInterval(() => this.broadcastPatch(), patchRate)` with the default 50 ms rate, and every
 * `broadcastPatch()` ticks the room clock (AegisRoom sets no simulation interval), so a room timer
 * such as the combat-window timeout can fire at whatever async boundary the interval lands on, as
 * well as inside the room's own `broadcastPatch()` calls. `recordRoomMatch({ clock: "real" })`
 * runs that same `__init`, so the clock here is ticked by the library's own interval.
 *
 * Only the bots' pacing is shortened, or a match would take minutes: every think delay and
 * reflex becomes a real `setTimeout` of 0–60 ms, which spreads the inputs over every phase of the
 * 50 ms patch interval. Which moves are played is still decided by the seeded policy, but when
 * they land relative to the patch tick is up to the real event loop, run by run.
 *
 * A replay can only be exact if the room drew no unseeded randomness, so every recording is checked
 * for `Math.random` calls. Seed 99 with the blocker decks shuffles security through an effect, which
 * once fell back to `Math.random`.
