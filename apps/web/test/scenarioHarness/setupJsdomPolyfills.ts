// them), which breaks any test driving the client's real drag-and-drop gesture
// (GameScreen.tsx's pointer-move-distance "started" threshold and its drop-point
// zone lookup both read `clientX`/`clientY` off the raw native event). A minimal
// `MouseEvent`-based polyfill (pointer id fields only) is enough for that gesture.
