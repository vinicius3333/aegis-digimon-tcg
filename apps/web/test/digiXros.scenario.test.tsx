// BT11-009 "Shoutmon + StarSword" (Red/Yellow, Lv.3, playCost 5) carries a DigiXros

// (packages/shared/src/effects/effects.json's `digiXrosRequirement`, compiled from
// the printed text). BT5-009 "Shoutmon" (Red, Lv.3) is a plain, on-play-effect-free*
// material source. (*Its own [On Play] never fires here — a DigiXros material is
// placed, not played.) Swapped 1:1 for RED_DECK's BT1-020 (Groundramon, count 4) and
// BT1-021 (MetalGreymon, count 4) so the deck stays legal and both swaps land in the
// array slots their originals held under the shuffle.

/**
 * Proves historical migration ledger behavioral scenario "digi-xros":
 * playing a DigiXros card, placing a named material card from hand under it through
 * the real UI, renders the DigiXros Digimon in the battle area (with the material
 * stacked underneath it, not merely discarded) and the memory gauge reflects the
 * reduced cost.
 *
 * Engine/UI gap (reported, not faked): a full "with expanders" proof would additionally
 * exercise an expander Tamer (BT19-079/BT19-087/EX4-062 — packages/shared/src/cards/
 * zoneExpanders.ts) suspending itself to unlock the trash/under-Tamer material
 * sources. That requires a material card already sitting UNDER a Tamer before the
 * DigiXros play — reachable only via a prior digivolve-onto-Tamer or placeUnder
 * effect, which would need its own multi-turn setup and a second, unrelated card
 * chain. This scenario proves the reachable core (materials selected through the UI,
 * a real cost reduction, the card entering play with materials stacked beneath it);
 * the expander-suspend path is left unproven rather than staged with an unreachable
 * board state.
