 * Swiss numbering (migration 009), so a quarterfinal of an event that played four Swiss rounds
 * renders here as "round 5" rather than "quarterfinal". `phases` carries the same confrontations
 * with phase-local round numbers and a phase kind — which is what `TopCutBracket` renders — so the
 * fix is to move `MyMatchPanel` onto `phases` and retire this array, not to renumber it here.
