/* Board sub-components — piles, permanents, breeding slot, memory gauge, hand,
   attack arrow. Presentational; they read real Permanent / count data and take
   interaction handlers (click / drop zones / pointer-drag) as props.

   Each piece now has its own file under ./piece, with the geometry and label
   maths beside them as pure functions. This file is the entry point they are
   still imported through. */
