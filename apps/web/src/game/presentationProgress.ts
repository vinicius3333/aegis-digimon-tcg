/* How far the presentation has got, in server revisions (docs/presentation-queue-plan.md 3.2).

   The board is rendered from the snapshot of the batch the queue is presenting, so the
   queue has to be able to say which batch that is. Steps are counted rather than timed: a
   batch is being presented while any step enqueued for it is still queued or running, and
   the batch being presented is the oldest such batch — the tracks run side by side, so a
   later batch's flight can already be in the air while an earlier batch's item is read.

   Nothing here decides anything about the game; it is bookkeeping over the queue. */

 * How long the board may stay behind the live state before it catches up regardless.

 * The count is the only thing that knows a step is over, and a step whose track is

 * the board frozen. One reading time plus a beat: long enough for the moment being read
 * out, short enough that nothing the viewer sees is ever stale for long.
