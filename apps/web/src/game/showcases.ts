/* Zone-change showcases: what the board plays when a card leaves one zone and
   appears in another.

   A public play is hide → centre-screen overlay → reveal (battle-animation-spec.md,
   "Cross-cutting notes" §1). Plays, evolutions and hatches share a
   colour-keyed burst — one component, keyed by the effect's colour vocabulary:
   a play takes the card's own colour, an evolution opens white into that colour, a hatch
   opens white/blue.
   A raised permanent moves between its existing slots without that burst.

   This module is the pure half: it decides, from a server event alone, which
   showcase and which burst an event earns. It reads no rules and infers no game
   state — seat, zone and card identity all come off the event payload. */
