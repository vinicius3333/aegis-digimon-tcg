/* When the match result may take the screen.

   The server ends the match the moment the last blow lands, and the live state says so in
   the same patch. The queue is usually still playing what led there: the [When Attacking]
   chain the viewer just ordered, the security check, the deletion. The result waits for
   that playback, so the splash never covers effects that are still being shown.

   Only presentation waits. Legality, the match timer and intents keep reading the live
   state, which is already over, so nothing can be played during the hold.

   Two clocks bound the hold, because a beat that never finishes must never hide the result:
   - the stall clock, restarted by every queue change, catches a queue that stopped moving;
   - the ceiling caps the whole hold, however busy the queue looks.
   Either one fast-forwards what is left and shows the result. */
