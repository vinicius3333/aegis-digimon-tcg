/**
 * The phase and turn ribbons, and everything the board holds back while one is on screen.
 *
 * Raw events, rather than batch closes, own the phase clock: the server closes each batch
 * only after sending its resulting state patch, so a ribbon keyed on the close would arrive
 * after the board it is meant to introduce.
 *
 * A ribbon waits for three things before it takes the screen — the batches its arrivals
 * belong to, the cues those batches queued ahead of it, and one readable beat for a clause it
 * is about to cover. All three are bounded by the same budget: a batch that keeps arriving
 * must never hold the ribbon for good.
 *
 * The hold is the other half. From the Unsuspend ribbon the presented board freezes at the
 * previous revision, so the draw the turn opens with stays hidden until its own Draw banner,
 * and the suspended cards stay suspended until the sweep runs. Draw, Breeding and Main each
 * release part of it, and a cancelled or non-live ribbon releases all of it at once.
