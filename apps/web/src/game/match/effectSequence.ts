/* Sequential pacing: one triggered effect is one unit, and units play strictly in turn.

   The server resolves a whole chain in a few milliseconds, but it closes each effect's
   announcement, its consequences and its resolution in batches of their own. Under the
   `current` pacing those batches are presented side by side, so the fourth effect's draw can
   fly while the first effect's clause is still being read. Under `sequential` pacing every
   effect gets three beats of its own, in server order:

   - announce: its source card lights up and its clause is the only clause on screen;
   - results:  everything its batches did plays, once the clause has been read for
               `announceMs`;
   - settle:   the board rests for `settleMs` before the next effect lights up.

   An effect that asks the viewer something (an optional "Use?") is announced before the
   prompt opens and resolved after it closes. What the answer did then gets a second announce
   beat, so it does not play the instant the prompt disappears.

   Every duration comes from `activePacing()` (../pacing), read when the beat starts. A minor
   effect, one that only changes memory or DP, reads and rests for the shorter `minor*` beats.

   A unit opens at `effectTriggered` and closes at the matching `effectResolved`; the
   batches in between are its consequences. The same effect firing again right after it
   resolved (three copies of one card reacting to one event) joins that unit instead of
   opening a new one, as long as the unit has not started: it is announced once, "×N", and
   plays every copy's results in its results beat. Two steps per unit on one serial track enforce
   the order: the first holds the board while the unit is announced, the second waits out
   the unit's results and the settle beat.

   Nothing here decides anything about the game; it is bookkeeping over the batches the
   server already closed. */
