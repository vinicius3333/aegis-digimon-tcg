/**
 * Every card an effect took out of a security stack, broken one at a time.
 *
 * Such a card is not checked, so nothing else narrates it — the stack simply got shorter. The
 * reference client plays the whole per-card sequence instead (shield break, the card revealed
 * centre-stage, then the card broken where it stands), once for EVERY card, so a Ragnarok
 * Cannon emptying a stack is seen card by card rather than as a counter dropping by four.
