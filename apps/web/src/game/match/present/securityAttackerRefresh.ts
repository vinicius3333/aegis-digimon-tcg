 * Keep the attacker on a running check's scene as the card it currently is.

 * for as long as the server needs. Effects that fire on "when your opponent's security
 * stack is removed from" digivolve the attacker in the middle of it, so by the time the
 * card is being looked at on centre stage it is a different Digimon than the one that
 * declared. The reveal captured its art once; without this the viewer watches the old card
 * fight, and the new one only appears when the check closes.
