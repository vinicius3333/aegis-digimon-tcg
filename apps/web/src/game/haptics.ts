/* The phone's answer to a tap.

   On a portrait phone the board tap is how a player moves the narration on
   (docs/presentation-queue-plan.md §3.2), and a tap that only changes text in a corner can
   read as a tap that missed. A single short buzz says the tap landed.

   Two guards, both deliberate: `navigator.vibrate` is absent on iOS and on every desktop
   browser, and a player who asked for reduced motion asked not to be shaken either. */
