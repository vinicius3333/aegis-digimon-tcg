/* The match screen's one notice system: the framed call-outs that used to be a
   rejection flash, a recovery toast and an effect-clause toast, each with its
   own placement and its own timer.

   A notice no longer owns a corner or a clock of its own. It is half of a
   narration item (narration.ts), and the animation queue presents one item at a
   time per slot: the viewer's side, the opponent's side, or the phone's single
   centred slot. A refused action is the exception — it answers the viewer's own
   tap, so it is shown at once rather than queued.

   This module is the pure half: the model and the mapping from server events.
   Card text and translation belong to NoticeStack.tsx. */
