 * card's mini width (matches CardMini's aspect ratio of height = width * 1.4).
 * Anchored toward the host's bottom-right corner (not its vertical middle) so it
 * reads as tucked under the host rather than pinned to its side.
 *
 * The "how much must peek" question is answered from CardMini's own TokenInfo
 * layout (apps/web/src/design/cards.tsx ~L305-320), not guessed: the readable
 * name+DP band is a full-width strip pinned to the card's bottom edge, sized
 * `paddingTop(12) + nameLineHeight(~9.5) + paddingBottom(4)` at width=92 scale,
 * i.e. ~29-30px of a 92*1.4=128.8px-tall mini card — about 23% of the card's
 * long edge. Below that, the strip carrying the card's name/cost/DP is clipped
 * and the link card is unreadable. `peek` below exposes 36%, with margin.
 *
 * The caller must rotate the link card counter-clockwise (not clockwise): a
 * counter-clockwise turn maps the card's original BOTTOM edge (where the
 * name/cost/DP band lives) onto the edge that ends up exposed on the right, so
 * the peeking strip is actually the readable band, not a stray edge of the
 * card's middle artwork.
