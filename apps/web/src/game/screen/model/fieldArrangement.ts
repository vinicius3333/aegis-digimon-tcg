/* How the organized field splits one battle area into two rows.

   The server keeps every permanent in one array in play order, and no rule reads that
   order back, so the client is free to present it differently. Digimon stay in the main
   row in play order, so digivolving a Digimon never moves it. Tamers and Options move
   to a smaller row, where copies that look and act the same collapse into one card
   with a count.

   Pure: the rows decide what "singled out" means from their own chrome. */
