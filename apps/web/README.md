# @aegis/web

The Aegis client: **React + Vite**. It is a pure function of the synchronized
Colyseus state and sends only _intents_ — it contains no game rules (see
[`../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[`../../docs/API-CONTRACT.md`](../../docs/API-CONTRACT.md)). The board and every
screen are rendered as plain React DOM over the Aegis design system; there is no
canvas/Pixi layer (a spatial renderer can be reintroduced behind the same state
projection if the board ever needs per-frame effects).

## Run

```bash
# from the repo root — runs shared (watch) + api (:2567) + web (:5173)
pnpm dev

# or just the client (expects an api already running on :2567)
pnpm --filter @aegis/web dev
```

The server URL is read from `VITE_AEGIS_API_URL` (default `ws://<host>:2567`).

```bash
pnpm --filter @aegis/web build       # tsc + vite production build
pnpm --filter @aegis/web typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

## UI review

Reviewing a match-screen styling change no longer needs a live match. The dev-only
page `/dev/board` renders every board piece and dialog from fixtures, in labeled
sections you can scroll.

- **In a browser:** start the dev server and open http://localhost:5173/dev/board.
- **As screenshots:** with the dev server up, run `node tools/ui-review.mjs` from the
  repository root. It drives the Orca browser CLI over each section anchor and writes
  one PNG per section to `ui-review/`. Override the binary and base URL with
  `ORCA_BIN` and `UI_REVIEW_URL`.

## What renders / how to interact

The board shows **both players'** synchronized zones: battle area (Digimon with
digivolution-stack depth, current DP, suspended rotation, linked/Tamer badges),
breeding slot, hand (your own face-up, the opponent's as a count), security / deck /
egg-deck / trash piles (counts, with a trash peek), and the shared memory gauge.
Cards render their real `CardDefinition` fields (name, play/digivolve cost, DP, level,
type, effect text) under a color-coded geometric **sigil** (`design/theme.ts`); real
art is a deferred seam keyed on `CardDefinition.imageId`.

Interaction (all clicks become server-validated intents):

- **Play / digivolve** — click a hand card to select it, then click your battle area
  to play it, or one of your Digimon to digivolve onto it.
- **Attack** — with nothing selected, click your Digimon to pick the attacker, then
  click the opponent's security to attack the player, or an opponent Digimon to
  attack it.
- **Decisions** — when the server raises a prompt, clicks toggle picks (for
  target/select) and the HUD's Confirm sends the response; optional/modal/order
  prompts and the mulligan / coin-toss are answered from the HUD directly.
- The action bar covers ready, hatch egg, end phase, surrender, and the block window
  (declare / decline) when one is open.

## Smoke test (connect + render + intent, headless)

With an api running on `:2567`:

```bash
node apps/web/scripts/smoke-connect.mjs
# AEGIS_SMOKE_ENDPOINT=ws://127.0.0.1:2567 node apps/web/scripts/smoke-connect.mjs
```

It joins two clients to the `aegis` room, prints each client's synchronized state,
and sends a few intents. `PASS` = both joined the same room and received the state.

> Until the engine's `deck-and-setup` / turn loop land (server side), zones are empty
> (counts 0), phase is `None`, and turn verbs come back as `not-implemented` /
> `wrong-phase` — the connect, per-seat state sync, and intent round trip all work and
> are surfaced in the in-app event log. The board will populate with real cards as
> soon as the server starts dealing them; no client change is needed.
