# EX12 strict card-by-card audit

Scope: EX12-001 through EX12-077, audited independently in ascending order with the
`verify-card-implementation` workflow. A card receives 10/10 only after its complete
catalog record, local KB results, direct IR module, shared runtime semantics, peer risks,
and observable behavioral tests have been checked. Collection gates do not substitute
for the individual evidence below.

## EX12-001 — Nyaromon — 10/10

- **Printed contract:** Yellow level 2 Digi-Egg, Lesser/VB. Its inherited
  `[End of Your Turn]` effect requires the host to have the VB trait, optionally DNA
  digivolves that host together with any one other own Digimon into a VB Digimon card
  in hand, pays the destination's DNA cost, and then independently allows the resulting
  Digimon to attack.
- **KB evidence:** `node tools/kb/query.mjs card EX12-001`; Q6722 confirms that the
  resulting Digimon's `[When Digivolving]` and `[When Attacking]` effects both trigger
  before the inherited effect finishes and can be activated in either order. Comprehensive
  Rules 15-4-2 through 15-4-4 define simultaneous triggering and pending activation.
- **Implementation trace:** `EndOfYourTurn` + `isInherited` maps the timing and source;
  `selfHasTrait(VB)` gates the host; `DnaDigivolve.materials.filter.includesSelf` pins the
  host while `count: 2` selects one other own Digimon; `into` restricts the hand result to
  VB; `payCost: true` preserves the destination recipe/cost; `bindResultAs: dnaResult`
  scopes the following optional `Attack` to the new permanent. The shared DNA handler
  pre-fills self, excludes it from partner selection, and calls `canDnaDigivolve` against
  the destination's printed material requirements.
- **Correction:** removed the erroneous VB trait filter from the material pool. It had
  required both materials to be VB even though the printed text permits any other
  Digimon. The host remains VB-gated and fixed as a material.
- **Behavioral proof:** the colocated suite now uses non-VB EX12-054 as a legal partner;
  proves the realistic EX12-042 + EX12-054 to EX12-044 evolution stack; observes both
  EX12-044 timing effects from Q6722 via the combined DP change; verifies zero paid DNA
  cost, host-trait rejection, invalid level/material rejection, missing-partner rejection,
  refusal of the DNA action, and independent refusal of the resulting attack.
- **Peer/mechanism proof:** EX12-044 supplies the real VB DNA destination and four printed
  color recipes; EX12-054 is the mixed-trait comparison; the focused
  `filter.includesSelf on DnaDigivolve materials` capability test verifies the shared
  source-pinning seam.
- **Verification:** `EX12-001.test.ts` — 7/7 passed; focused DNA capability regression —
  1/1 passed. No residual IR, unsupported behavior, or unresolved card-specific ambiguity.

## EX12-002 — Mococomon — 10/10

- **Printed contract:** Yellow level 2 Digi-Egg, Smoke/Shambala/SW. During its
  controller's turn, once per turn, another own SW Digimon being played triggers the
  inherited effect. Its host may legally digivolve into an SW Digimon card in hand,
  paying the normal digivolution cost reduced by 2.
- **KB evidence:** `node tools/kb/query.mjs card EX12-002`; Q6723 says the played
  Digimon's `[On Play]` and Mococomon's inherited effect trigger simultaneously. If
  Mococomon resolves first and digivolves, the newly derived `[When Digivolving]`
  effect must activate before the still-pending `[On Play]` effect. Comprehensive Rules
  15-4-4 through 15-4-5 define pending activation and derived-trigger priority.
- **Implementation trace:** persistent `YourTurn` installs a `whenPlayed` watcher;
  `controller: mine`, `excludeSelf`, `kind: Digimon`, and exact SW trait matching scope
  the event. The nested `Digivolve` pins Mococomon's host, searches only the hand for an
  SW Digimon, enforces the destination's printed requirements, pays cost, applies the
  two-memory reduction, and remains optional. The watcher carries a stable once-per-turn
  key across continuous recomputation.
- **Corrections:** added the missing `payCost: true`; previously every accepted evolution
  was free and the old cost-2 fixture concealed the error. The shared pending-watcher
  adapter now retains whether its printed source was inherited or linked, so the kernel
  does not reject a valid buried source. The resolver now treats derived triggers as a
  separate priority tier even when the derived and pending effects share a controller,
  closing Q6723's same-player ordering case.
- **Behavioral proof:** the positive stack is EX12-002 → EX12-006 → EX12-012 and then
  EX12-045, whose cost 3 becomes 1; memory visibly moves from 0 to -1. Tests reject a
  non-SW played Digimon, an opponent's SW Digimon, the host itself, the opponent's turn,
  and legal Shambala-but-not-SW EX12-011. They prove optional refusal, once-per-turn
  consumption, and a second otherwise-legal EX12-045 evolution being blocked.
- **Ruling proof:** a real EX12-022 play offers EX12-022 and inherited EX12-002 as
  simultaneous triggers. Choosing Mococomon first produces the observable resolution
  order EX12-002 → derived EX12-012 `[When Digivolving]` → pending EX12-022 `[On Play]`,
  exactly as Q6723 requires.
- **Verification:** `EX12-002.test.ts` — 9/9; stack, sub-trigger, and CR 15-4 focused
  suites — 93/93; interpreter, primitives, and capability regressions — 586/586;
  workspace typecheck passed. No residual IR, unsupported behavior, or unresolved
  card-specific ambiguity.
