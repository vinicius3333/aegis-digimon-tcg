# Arts Digivolve and stale On Play effects

## Contract

Effects triggered by cards an Option plays remain pending until the Option has finished resolving and completed its post-use routing. For a DUAL card, that routing includes the optional Arts Digivolve overwrite before the normal trash step.

While `optionResolutionDepth` is nonzero, the resolver withholds nested entry effects and their parked play-event watchers from unrelated collection passes. Once the Option completes routing, a dedicated On Play drain revalidates each pending source. If Arts Digivolve placed the DUAL card on top of a played Digimon, the former top card has become a digivolution card and its pending printed On Play effect cannot activate.

The digivolution itself remains complete before this revalidation, including its mandatory evolution bonus draw and its own valid entry timings.

## Q7430/Q7434 regressions

Divine Pierce (Awakened) EX13-065 and Mickey Bullet (Awakened) EX13-066 may play Sistermon Blanc or Sistermon Noir, then Arts Digivolve onto that played Digimon. The played Sistermon's pending On Play effect is removed because its source is no longer the top card. The only deck reduction in the Blanc case is the evolution bonus draw; Noir's lost On Play memory effect likewise does not activate.

Covered by `engine/artsDigivolvePendingOnPlay.test.ts` and the focused EX13-065 Q7430 / EX13-066 Q7434 tests.
