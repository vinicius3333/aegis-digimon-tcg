   * "unless [the Option] is considered to be placed in an area" — for effects that
   * relocate themselves mid-resolution (e.g. PlaceInBattleAreaSelf turning an Option
   * into a permanent, BT18-100); `effects/primitives.ts`' `peekLooseInstance` /
   * `removeLooseInstance` read and claim this slot for exactly that case, so
   * `playCard.ts` only falls back to trashing it when nothing claimed it. Otherwise
   * `playCard.ts` clears the slot and trashes the card unconditionally once
   * activation finishes, even if the effect threw.
   *
   * No `@view` tag: the card was already revealed to use it (§9-1-9-1), so it
   * resolving face-up is public information, same as the battle area or trash.
